Even though I am two years older than Jen, I can’t ever remember life without her. Jen has the whole package- and I honestly have never met a cooler person, ever! I have always been really protective of Jen, and I can’t think of a better person than Adam to pass the buck to. I know he will always have Jen’s best interest at heart and will look after her and Maddox forever and always. I can’t wait to see what memories we have yet to make… -Christina lives in London, England with her husband, Stephen, and their two children, Noah and Scarlett.  ">

Despite being five years younger, Jen tells me I am an old soul. As a result, we enjoy talking about very mature subjects. These include talks of retirement, the high markup prices we pay for consumer goods, and what would be the perfect tax system. Jen and I have a very humorous relationship and we are always making each other laugh. Even when Jen was half away around the world in Spain we found innovative ways to laugh till our cheeks hurt.
While I obviously haven't known Adam as long as Jen, Adam and I go way back to the 'Martinique' days of living together. This is where I learned a whole new spin on working out, cooking, and how serious Adam takes Gator games. Oh the good ole days.
Anyways, cheers to Jen and Adam for tying the knot! I love you both. I wish you nothing but happiness for the rest of your lives...
Love,
Liz" >

I guess she felt like her secrets were safe with me and each day would come to me with details of all the things going on in her life.  Even though her stories were crazy, I longed to be just like her. Somewhere along the way we became friends…best friends, referred to each other as 'Jen-Squared' and told everyone that were first cousins.
Almost 19 years later Jen feels like way more than a cousin, I still admire her in every way and, of course, will never stop loving her crazy stories! Jen is one of the smartest, funniest and most beautiful people, both inside and out, I have ever known. I feel so honored to be her friend and to be a part of her wedding. Jen lives in Atlanta, GA with her husband, Tyler, and their two children, Mason and Travis.">

						<a href="#" data-largesrc="images/dylan.jpg" d data-title="Dylan Brown" data-description="Adam has always been my big, tough brother. Even to this day, he still seems like a superhero to me. Growing up with him has been such a great adventure and I’ve always known I could count on him. Not only is Adam the oldest brother, he has also been another father figure in my life. All the times we have lived together I have learned something new and was always being pushed to be the best. And, one thing I know for sure is that there is no bigger Florida Gator fan than him! I am very happy for Adam and all that he has in his life and all that he has achieved. 

Congrats Aam on your beautiful fiance and my awesome nephew Maddox. ">

					<a href="#" data-largesrc="images/corey.jpg" d data-title="Corey Brown" data-description="Adam was not just a big brother, but a second father to all of us. That is why he got the nickname Dadam. He was the one that never let me slip away from sports and made sure I gave 100% in everything I did. It's always fun trash talking with Adam because no matter what you say about him, (can be the smallest thing) he's going for the jugular for his comeback. Then it usually leads to Adam getting physical, cause his strength overpowers anyone. Therefore we lose and he's back on top as....Dadam.

" data-description="Since I can remember Adam has had our family’s best interest in mind, and he’s always had a special way of letting us know. I can remember that since I was a child I’ve never had to watch my own back or worry about anyone picking on me because Adam had a proactive approach to ALL of South Tampa by letting them know that-anyone with the last name Brown was off limits-to the point of people finding out who I was and literally saying 'Oh Adam Brown’s brother…naw we’re cool.' 
The thing about Adam is that when he is passionate about something nothing can stop him from getting to where he wants to be. He will be sure to let you know what it is he wants and just how he is going to accomplish it- whether it is football or money he is relentless. 

Now over the years of him awkwardly letting people know how he feels and trying to tame the beast within, he has most definitely made a name for his self, a name that is feared as much as it is respected . But, most importantly he has worked his ass off to be the best husband to Jen and Father to Maddox that he could ever be. I have learned a lot from my brother and I am grateful to have experienced so much in life with him by my side to lead me, protect me, save my ass, and unconditionally love me. I truly believe that If you are lucky enough in life you will get to share half the memories I have made with him, with those we love the most, and I undoubtedly know that Adam Brown loves his family and friends more than words can describe.
 
I am thankful for Adam being such an inspirational, hard working, loyal, dedicated, faithful and ALWAYS (whether its good or bad) HONEST man and big brother. I love you.

" data-description="When I was little and my mom got pregnant, the prospect of a little brother excited me.  So I wished and prayed that it would be a boy…because I didn’t really want a sister.  Nine months later, Adam came into my life and my wish came true.  A little brother, the first of five little brothers, so I must have wished pretty hard to make it happen five times over! Adam grew up to be a great kid and then an example of what a man should be: caring, responsible, loyal and hard-working.  His family-centered values are unquestionable and he makes me proud every day to call him my brother.  Welcome to the family Jen!  We are blessed to have you as a sister.">

What started as an invitation to dinner and Madden, lead to my being the friend he decided to  invite to Vegas that year. From that experience, I knew I had a lifelong friend in Adam Brown. Now we have been best friends for over 15 years, and I truly value our friendship.

Our friend was being watched by their grandparent.  We snuck onto the back porch of the house and I climbed up over the rail.  I then came around the side of the porch and was giving Adam a hand up over the same rail that held my weight just fine.  As I was helping him get up, the rail broke (with an extremely loud noise) and we fell about 8 feet into the bushes.  Of course it woke everyone in the house up and Adam and I found ourselves laying in the bushes and laughing while being yelled out by a 5 foot tall Spanish lady with a golf club who thought we were robbers.  The whole misunderstanding was cleared up after much apology, laughing, and cleaning dirt and mulch out of our teeth.
