            Jen had a feeling it was coming. Afterall, they had just experienced the greatest miracle in life together- the birth of their son Maddox Liam. Jen was getting a little itchy, and not in the homeless needs-a-bath kind of way. She was hoping that the love of her life was going to ask her to get married soon! The holidays came and went, and still, no bling! It has been four wonderful years. <br />  <br />During what seemed to be a routine diaper change, Jen discovered what she first thought was an obscene piercing on her son. After being momentarily shocked, further investigation revealed that this was none other than a shiny, beautiful diamond ring! Astonished she looked around the room, and her best friend Adam was on his knee. Jen confusedly handed him the ring so that he could properly put in on her shaking hand. Thankfully, Maddox didn't roll off the changing table during the ordeal! The two hugged and kissed and then the phone calls began! Jen's aunt Kathy watched Maddox and Jen and Adam went to a New Year's Eve Party at Corey and Bridget's house (Adam's brother and sister-in law). They got to celebrate with family and friends on the night of their engagement!
